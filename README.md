# Latent Variable Models
Latent variable models applied in Single Cell Analysis. [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/) is one of the most popular tools analysing array data from Single Cell analysis. There are two major steps in the processing pipeline provided by Seurat: first, dimension reduction; second, cell clustering. The first problem is solved by Seurat via PCA: the eigenvalue of the n+1-th principal component is plotted against the number of components. The optimal dimension n is then defined by an Elbow-method indicating a saturation of the decrease in the eigenvalue for increasing n. The second probelm is solved by a graph based clustering approach building upon [Macosko et al](http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(15)00549-8). Both methods can be improved via latent variable models. 

PCA might be replaced by Probabilistic alternatives, like [Probabilistic PCA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/probabilistic-principal-component-analysis/) or [Bayesian PCA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/bayesian-pca/): both generative models which are supposed to deal with missing values as well. Handling missing values in Single Cell analysis is an important topic because most gene-cell combinations are not tested and their values not known. Currently, one deals with those missing entries filling them with zeros. Diverging from linear dimensional reduction schemes in favour of non-linear ones would yield Autoencoders as promising candidates for dimension reduction in single cell analysis. However, since we deal with very high dimensional data, applying Autoencoders would not necessarily improve the representation of the data by a lower dimensional space but only further reduce the dimenion of the latent space which is, in general, not that interesting. More promising is the combination of the two approaches: non-linear, generative models. If we aim for those models we enter the realm of deep-generative models: Normalizing Flows, GANs, and Autoencoders. The benefits of these models will be studied in this repository.

Cluster models may be also replaced by latent generative models. Promising candidates are mixture models with different likelihoods and priors. [STAN](https://mc-stan.org/) is a probabilistic programming language which allows for sampling from those models even for non-conjugate priors via [Automatic Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03431). This allows for Bayesian Inference for mixture models and predicting class probabilities, that is, a soft clustering, instead of a hard-clustering which assigns 1 to one class and 0 otherwise, provided by Seuart. Evaluating and implementing STAN models for Single Cell data is a goal of this repo as well.
